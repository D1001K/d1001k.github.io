        <h2>Crash Course Computer Science #2</h2>
        <h3>June 14, 2018</h3>
        <p>The computers built during world war 2 were gigantic, cabin sized machines, that sometimes took over a  minute for complex operations.
            The huge, dark, warm machines were not only slow, but it attracted insects to it. In September 1947, the engineers on the Harvard mark 2 pulled a dead moth from a malfunction. That's where we gotthe term "bugs" when the machines slowed down.
            The "computers" needed a faster, but more reliable relay to replace electro-mechanical systems. However, that system had already existed.
            In 1904, physicist John Fleming created a new component called a thermionic valve. The thermionic valve was the first vaccum tube. It used a process called a thermionic emission.
            In 1906, inventor Lee de Forest created a third control electrode that was based off Fleming's design.
            The first electric computer was the Colossus Mark 1 made by engineer Tommy Flowers which was completed in the Deceber of 1943. It helped to decrypt nazi codes.
